        <p>This project serves to assemble my portfolio and accelerate my learning process.</p>
        <p> As we already know, the process of making a website responsive usually takes a little more time, so if you want to view the content of this site, please access it through a larger screen. </p>
        <p> Throughout these projects, I intend to alternate between desktop and mobile, but my main focus is to accelerate the learning process quickly and effectively. Thank you!</p>
